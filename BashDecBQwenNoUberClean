BuildBrain: The AI Co-Pilot for Construction
  The AI Operating System for Construction Execution
Secret Sauce:

    Construction DNA: Team understands the industry intimately
    AI as co-pilot: Augments humans, doesn't replace
    Proactive, not reactive: Flags issues before they become problems
    Mobile-first: Superintendents use on-site, not just in office
    Voice interface: "Hey BuildBrain, what's the status of..."

        "Procore + Bluebeam don’t think. BuildBrain does."
    TAM: $1.3T+ | Target: General Contractors & Large Subcontractors
    Path to $300M+ ARR in 5 Years → Unicorn → Billionaire Exit
    
    Construction loses 10–15% of project value to:

    RFIs & change orders (avg. 30–50 days delay per RFI)  
    Subcontractor no-shows (40% of delays traced to subs)  
    Expired insurance/compliance → $50K+ fines per incident  
    Blueprint misreads → rework = 5–10% of total cost  
    Safety violations → OSHA fines + stop-work orders
    
        GCs spend 50% of their day on admin, not building.

Existing tools (Procore, Autodesk, Bluebeam) are passive systems of record — they store data but don’t act.
